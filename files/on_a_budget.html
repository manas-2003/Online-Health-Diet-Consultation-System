        <h1>19 tips for <i>On A Budget</i>Diet</h1>
        <img src="https://www.weightlossresources.co.uk/img/b/budget-diet-plan.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Nutritious food can be expensive, and it can be difficult to eat a balanced diet that includes fruits and vegetables when you’re on a tight budget.</p>
        <p>The good news is, there are many ways you can save money and still eat whole foods. In fact, here are 19 tips that can help you eat healthier when you’re on a budget.</p>
        <h2>1. Plan your meals</h2>
        <li>When it comes to saving money at the grocery store, planning ahead is essential.</li>
        <li>Pick 1 day each week and on that day, plan your meals for the upcoming week. Then, make a grocery list of everything you need to prepare those meals.</li>
        <li>Make sure to also scan your fridge and cabinets to see what you already have. You may have foods hidden in the back that can be used, or you may want to plan your meals around foods you need to use before they expire.</li>
        <li>Only plan to purchase what you know you’re going to use. This way, you won’t end up throwing away a lot of what you buy and don’t use.</li>
        <h2>2. Stick to your grocery list</h2>
        <li>Once you’ve planned your meals and made your grocery list, stick to it.</li>
        <li>It’s very easy to get sidetracked at the grocery store, which can lead to unintended purchases — and unintended expense.</li>
        <li>As a general rule, try to shop the perimeter (the outer edges) of the store first. This is where whole foods are generally placed and will make you more likely to fill your cart with them first.</li>
        <li>The middle of the store often contains the most processed foods. If you find yourself in these aisles, look to the top or bottom of the shelves, rather than straight ahead. The most expensive items are usually placed at eye level.</li>
        <li>Additionally, you can download a grocery list app to help you shop. Some of them can even save favorite items or share lists between multiple shoppers.</li>
        <li>Using an app is also a great way to make sure you don’t forget your list at home</li>
        <h2>3. Cook at home</h2>
        <li>Cooking at home can be cheaper than dining out. Generally, you can feed a family of four for the same price as buying food for one or two people at a restaurant.</li>
        <li>So, make it a habit to cook at home, rather than deciding to eat out at the last minute.</li>
        <li>Some people find it best to cook for the entire week on the weekends, while others cook one meal each day.</li>
        <li>By cooking for yourself, you also gain the benefit of knowing exactly what ingredients are in your meals.</li>
        <h2>4. Cook large portions and use your leftovers</h2>
        <li>Cooking large meals can save you both time and money.</li>
        <li>Leftovers can be used for lunches or in other recipes. They can be reused in stews, stir-fries, salads and burritos.</li>
        <li>It is great when you are on a budget because having leftovers can stop you from eating out on days when you don’t have time to cook a meal from scratch.</li>
        <li>You can also freeze leftovers in single-portion sizes to enjoy at a later date.</li>
        <h2>5. Don’t shop when you’re hungry</h2>
        <li>If you go to the grocery store while hungry, you’re more likely to stray from your grocery list and buy something on impulse.</li>
        <li>When you’re hungry, you may often reach for processed foods that have fewer beneficial nutrients than whole foods. And since these generally aren’t on your list, they’re not good for your budget, either.</li>
        <li>Try to eat a piece of fruit, yogurt, or another nutritious snack before you go to the store, this way you won’t be hungry when you get there.</li>
        <h2>6. Buy whole foods</h2>
        <li>Some foods are more affordable in a less processed form. For example, a block of cheese is cheaper than shredded cheese, and canned beans are less expensive than refried ones.</li>
        <li>Whole grains, like brown rice and oats, are also cheaper per serving than most processed cereals.</li>
        <li>Less processed foods are also often sold in larger quantities and yield more servings per package, saving you money overall.</li>
        <h2>7. Buy generic brands</h2>
        <li>Most stores offer generic brands for nearly any product.</li>
        <li>All food manufacturers have to follow standards to provide safe food. The generic brands may be the same quality as other national brands, just less expensive.</li>
        <li>That said, read the ingredients list to make sure that you’re not getting a product of lower quality than the national brand or one that contains any unexpected added ingredients or allergens.</li>
        <h2>8. Avoid buying highly processed food</h2>
        <li>You might be surprised to see how much you’re paying for highly processed foods like soda, crackers, cookies, and prepackaged meals.</li>
        <li>Despite the fact that they often lack beneficial nutrients and may be high in sodium or added sugar, they’re also very expensive.</li>
        <li>By skipping processed foods, you can spend more of your budget on higher quality, nutrient-rich whole foods.</li>
        <h2>9. Stock up on sales</h2>
        <li>If you have favorite products or staples that you use frequently, you should stock up on them when they’re on sale.</li>
        <li>If you’re sure that the item is something you’ll definitely use, you may as buy it now to save a little money later.</li>
        <li>Just make sure that it will last for a while and won’t expire in the meantime. You won’t save you any money if you buy something you’ll just end up throwing out.</li>
        <h2>10. Buy cheaper cuts of meat</h2>
        <li>Fresh meat and fish can be quite expensive. However, you can get many cuts of meat that cost way less. Look for chuck steak, pork top sirloin steak, whole chicken, or ground meat or poultry.</li>
        <li>These are great to use in burritos, casseroles, soups, stews and stir fries.</li>
        <li>It may also be helpful to buy a large and inexpensive cut of meat to use in several different meals during the week.</li>
        <h2>11. Replace meat with other proteins</h2>
        <li>Eating less meat may be a good way to save money.</li>
        <li>Try having a couple of days per week where you use other protein sources, such as legumes, hemp seeds, eggs, or canned fish.</li>
        <li>These are all very inexpensive, nutritious, and easy to prepare. Most of them also have a long shelf life and are therefore less likely to spoil quickly.</li>
        <h2>12. Shop for produce that’s in season</h2>
        <li>Local produce that’s in season is generally cheaper than out-of-season options. It’s also usually at its peak in both nutrients and flavor.</li>
        <li>Produce that’s not in season has often been transported from far away to get to your store, which isn’t good for either the environment or your budget.</li>
        <li>Also, buy produce by the bag if you can. That’s usually a lot cheaper than buying by the piece.</li>
        <li>If you buy more than you need, you can freeze the rest or incorporate it into next week’s meal plans.</li>
        <h2>13. Buy frozen fruits and vegetables</h2>
        <li>Fresh fruits, berries, and vegetables are usually in season for only a few months per year, and they’re sometimes rather expensive.</li>
        <li>Quick-frozen produce is usually just as nutritious. It’s also cheaper, available all year, and usually sold in large bags.</li>
        <li>Frozen produce is great to use when cooking, making smoothies, or as toppings for oatmeal or yogurt.</li>
        <li>Plus, you gain the advantage of being able to take out only what you’re about to use. The rest will be kept safe from spoiling in the freezer.</li>
        <li>Reducing produce waste is a great way to save money.</li>
        <h2>14. Buy in bulk</h2>
        <li>Buying some foods in bulk quantities can save you a lot of money.</li>
        <li>Grains such as brown rice, millet, barley, and oats, are all available in bulk.</li>
        <li>They also keep for a long time if you store them in airtight containers. This is also true for beans, lentils, some nuts, and dried fruit.</li>
        <li>These are all staple foods that are relatively inexpensive and can be used in a variety of nutritious meals.</li>
        <h2>15. Grow your own produce</h2>
        <li>If you can, it’s a great idea to grow your own produce or join a community garden.</li>
        <li>Seeds are very cheap to buy. With some time and effort, you may be able to grow your own herbs, sprouts, tomatoes, onions, and many more delicious crops.</li>
        <li>Having a continuous supply at home saves you money at the store.</li>
        <li>Home-grown produce may also taste a lot better than the store-bought varieties. You can also guarantee that it is picked at peak ripeness.</li>
        <h2>16. Pack your lunch</h2>
        <li>Eating out is very expensive, especially if done regularly. Packing your lunch, snacks, drinks, and other meals is less expensive than dining out.</li>
        <li>Plus, you’ll have complete control over the foods you eat and can choose options with lots of beneficial nutrients.</li>
        <li>If you have adapted to cooking large meals at home (see tip 4), you’ll always have a steady lunch to bring with you, without any additional effort or cost.</li>
        <li>This does require some planning, but it should save you a lot of money in the long term.</li>
        <h2>17. Use coupons wisely</h2>
        <li>Coupons are a great way to save some money — just be sure to use them wisely.</li>
        <li>Sort out the good quality deals and stock up on cleaning products, nutrient-rich foods, and other staples that you’ll definitely use.</li>
        <li>By cutting the cost of products needed around the house, you can spend more of your budget on nutritious foods.</li>
        <h2>18. Appreciate less expensive foods</h2>
        <li>A lot of foods are both inexpensive and nutritious. By making some adjustments and using ingredients that you may not be used to, you can prepare many delicious and inexpensive meals.</li>
        <li>Try increasing your use of eggs, beans, seeds, frozen fruits and vegetables, cheaper cuts of meat, and whole grains.</li>
        <li>These all taste great, are cheap (especially in bulk), and are very nutritious.</li>
        <h2>19. Buy from cheap, online retailers</h2>
        <li>There are several online retailers that offer nutritious foods for up to 50% cheaper than the grocery store.</li>
        <li>By registering, you get access to daily discounts and deals. What’s more, the products are then delivered straight to your door.</li>
        <li>There are online retailers that focus exclusively on nutritious and unprocessed foods.</li>
        <li>Buying as much as you can from these types of retailers can save you money.</li>
