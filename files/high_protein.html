        <h1>High protein diet:</h1>
          <h1>  What it is and how to do it</h1>
        <p>You may have heard that high protein diets can help with weight loss and metabolic health. That’s why, at Diet Doctor, we feature high protein recipes and meal plans. But how do you know if a higher protein diet is right for you?</p>
        <p>This guide will explain what high protein diets are, help you find the best high protein foods, and explore the potential benefits of high protein diets.
        </p>

     <h1> 1. What is a high protein diet?</h1>
<P>A high protein diet is one where you work on getting plenty of protein — probably more than you are used to getting — as the first focus of your eating patterns. Protein-rich foods include eggs, meat, seafood, legumes, and dairy products. These foods are not only high in protein but high in nutrients in general. That means a high protein diet is also a high nutrition diet.</P>

<p>Increasing protein can be very helpful for weight loss because protein can help tame your appetite. It also supplies plenty of the raw materials needed to maintain your muscles and your metabolism, both of which help ensure that you’re burning calories at an appropriate rate.</p>

<p>For people who want to build muscle, getting more protein than is typically recommended is a must. Current recommendations, known as the RDA or the recommended dietary allowance, are designed for “healthy people” and meant to prevent malnutrition; they aren’t meant to help increase muscle mass or improve medical conditions such as type 2 diabetes.</p>

<p>Diets with increased protein can have a positive effect on the treatment and prevention of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, and possibly even heart disease. Higher protein intake also helps prevent sarcopenia, which is a loss of muscle mass that can occur as you age, and a related condition, osteoporosis, which is a loss of bone mass.</p>
<h1>2. What are the best high protein foods?</h1>

<p>The best choices for high protein diets are foods with a high protein percentage. The protein percentage of a food tells you how much protein per calorie a food has. Foods with a lot of protein and less fat and carbohydrate are ranked higher, as are low-fat, low-carb foods with a lot of fiber.</p>

<p>Foods in the middle range of protein percentage can help you maintain your weight and your muscle mass. Going a little higher — over 30 or 35% — may help you lose weight.</p>

<p>Foods with a lower protein percentage may lead to weight gain, while foods with the highest protein percentage may be good choices for someone who is really trying to reduce body fat and become lean and fit.</p>

<p>Fortunately, most high protein foods are delicious and have plenty of vitamins and minerals, too. You can start with this list of the best high protein foods.</p>
<ul><font size="5" color="black">
<li>Meat and poultry: beef, chicken, lamb, turkey</li>
<li>Seafood: shrimp, crab, salmon, tuna</li>
<li>Eggs: whole eggs or egg whites</li>
<li>Dairy: cottage cheese, greek yogurt</li>
<li>Legumes: Beans, lentils, peas, and soy</li>
<li>Non-starchy vegetables: spinach, cauliflower, broccoli, mushrooms</li></ul></font>
<p>If your diet consists mainly of the above foods, you are on your way to eating a healthy diet with plenty of protein.</p>

<p>Remember that non-starchy vegetables may have a high protein percentage, but they won’t give you the total protein, calories, or all the nutrients you need. Base your meals around a protein source — whether from animals or plants — and add high-protein-percentage vegetables for a little extra boost of amino acids, the building blocks of protein. Add just enough fat to make your meals delicious and filling. This approach will keep the total protein percentage of your meals high.</p>

<p>Here are a few tips to help you increase how much protein you eat and ensure you get adequate protein without adding too many unnecessary calories:</p>
<ul><font size="5" color="black">
<li>Add extra egg whites to your scrambled eggs or omelets.</li>
<li>Replace lower protein snacks, like nuts and cheese, with higher protein versions like lupini beans, zero-sugar jerky, or cold cuts.</li>
<li>Include your favorite foods that are higher than 35% protein. Choose from the highest protein foods such as shrimp, chicken breasts, and lean cuts of meat.</li>
<li>Swap higher fat cheese and yogurt with low-fat cheese or Greek yogurt. The lower-fat versions have higher protein percentages and therefore more protein per calorie.</li></ul></font>
