        <h1>What Is a <i> Vegetarian </i> Diet?</h1>
        <img src="https://images-prod.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/AN_images/vegetarian-diet-plan-1296x728-feature.jpg"  height="400px" alt="">
        <p>The vegetarian diet involves abstaining from eating meat, fish and poultry.</p>
        <p>People often adopt a vegetarian diet for religious or personal reasons, as well as ethical issues, such as animal rights.</p>
        <p>Others decide to become vegetarian for environmental reasons, as livestock production increases greenhouse gas emissions, contributes to climate change and requires large amounts of water, energy and natural resources.</p>
        <p>There are several forms of vegetarianism, each of which differs in their restrictions.</p>
        <p>The most common types include:</p>
        <li><p><b>Lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet:</b> Eliminates meat, fish and poultry but allows eggs and dairy products.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Lacto-vegetarian diet:</b> Eliminates meat, fish, poultry and eggs but allows dairy products.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Pescetarian diet:</b> Eliminates meat and poultry but allows fish and sometimes eggs and dairy products.</p></li>
        <li><p style="display: inline;"><b>Vegan diet:</b> Eliminates meat, fish, poultry, eggs and dairy products, as well as other animal-derived products, such as honey.</p></li>
        <li><p style="display: inline-flex;"><b>Flexitarian diet:</b> A mostly vegetarian diet that incorporates occasional meat, fish or poultry.</p></li>
        <h2>Health Benefits</h2>
        <p>Vegetarian diets are associated with a number of health benefits.</p>
        <p>In fact, studies show that vegetarians tend to have better diet quality than meat-eaters and a higher intake of important nutrients like fiber, vitamin C, vitamin E and magnesium .</p>
        <p>A vegetarian diet may provide several other health boosts as well.</p>
        <h3>May Enhance Weight Loss</h3>
        <p>Switching to a vegetarian diet can be an effective strategy if you’re looking to lose weight.</p>
        <p>In fact, one review of 12 studies noted that vegetarians, on average, experienced 4.5 more pounds (2 kg) of weight loss over 18 weeks than non-vegetarians.</p>
        <p>Similarly, a six-month study in 74 people with type 2 diabetes demonstrated that vegetarian diets were nearly twice as effective at reducing body weight than low-calorie diets .</p>
        <p>Plus, a study in nearly 61,000 adults showed that vegetarians tend to have a lower body mass index (BMI) than omnivores — BMI being a measurement of body fat based on height and weight.</p>
        <h3>May Reduce Cancer Risk</h3>
        <p>Some research suggests that a vegetarian diet may be linked to a lower risk of cancer — including those of the breast, colon, rectum and stomach .</p>
        <p>However, current research is limited to observational studies, which cannot prove a cause-and-effect relationship. Keep in mind that some studies have turned up inconsistent findings.</p>
        <p>Therefore, more research is needed to understand how vegetarianism may impact cancer risk.</p>
        <h3>May Stabilize Blood Sugar</h3>
        <p>Several studies indicate that vegetarian diets may help maintain healthy blood sugar levels.</p>
        <p>For instance, one review of six studies linked vegetarianism to improved blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes.</p>
        <p>Vegetarian diets may also prevent diabetes by stabilizing blood sugar levels in the long term.</p>
        <p>According to one study in 2,918 people, switching from a non-vegetarian to a vegetarian diet was associated with a 53% reduced risk of diabetes over an average of five years.</p>
        <h3>Promotes Heart Health</h3>
        <p>Vegetarian diets reduce several heart disease risk factors to help keep your heart healthy and strong.</p>
        <p>One study in 76 people tied vegetarian diets to lower levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol and “bad” LDL cholesterol — all of which are risk factors for heart disease when elevated.</p>
        <p>Similarly, another recent study in 118 people found that a low-calorie vegetarian diet was more effective at reducing “bad” LDL cholesterol than a Mediterranean diet.</p>
        <p>Other research indicates that vegetarianism may be associated with lower blood pressure levels. High blood pressure is another key risk factor for heart disease.</p>
        <h2>Potential Downsides</h2>
        <p>A well-rounded vegetarian diet can be healthy and nutritious.</p>
        <p>However, it may also increase your risk of certain nutritional deficiencies.</p>
        <p>Meat, poultry and fish supply a good amount of protein and omega-3 fatty acids, as well as micronutrients like zinc, selenium, iron and vitamin B12.</p>
        <p>Other animal products like dairy and eggs also contain plenty of calcium, vitamin D and B vitamins.</p>
        <p>When cutting meat or other animal products from your diet, it’s important to ensure you’re getting these essential nutrients from other sources.</p>
        <p>Studies show that vegetarians are at a higher risk of protein, calcium, iron, iodine and vitamin B12 deficiencies.</p>
        <p>A nutritional deficiency in these key micronutrients can lead to symptoms like fatigue, weakness, anemia, bone loss and thyroid issues.</p>
        <p>Including a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, protein sources and fortified foods is an easy way to ensure you’re getting appropriate nutrition.</p>
        <p>Multivitamins and supplements are another option to quickly bump up your intake and compensate for potential deficiencies.</p>
        <h2>Foods to Eat</h2>
        <p>A vegetarian diet should include a diverse mix of fruits, vegetables, grains, healthy fats and proteins.</p>
        <p>To replace the protein provided by meat in your diet, include a variety of protein-rich plant foods like nuts, seeds, legumes, tempeh, tofu and seitan.</p>
        <p>If you follow a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet, eggs and dairy can also boost your protein intake.</p>
        <p>Eating nutrient-dense whole foods like fruits, vegetables and whole grains will supply a range of important vitamins and minerals to fill in any nutritional gaps in your diet.</p>
        <p>A few healthy foods to eat on a vegetarian diet are:</p>
        <li><p><b>Fruits:</b> Apples, bananas, berries, oranges, melons, pears, peaches</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Vegetables:</b> Leafy greens, asparagus, broccoli, tomatoes, carrots</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Grains:</b> Quinoa, barley, buckwheat, rice, oats</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Legumes:</b> Lentils, beans, peas, chickpeas.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Nuts:</b> Almonds, walnuts, cashews, chestnuts</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Seeds:</b> Flaxseeds, chia and hemp seeds</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Healthy fats:</b> Olive oil, avocados</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Proteins:</b> Tempeh, tofu, seitan, natto, nutritional yeast, spirulina, eggs, dairy products</p></li>
        <h2>Foods to Avoid</h2>
        <p>There are many variations of vegetarianism, each with different restrictions.</p>
        <p>Lacto-ovo vegetarianism, the most common type of vegetarian diet, involves eliminating all meat, poultry and fish.</p>
        <p>Other types of vegetarians may also avoid foods like eggs and dairy.</p>
        <p>A vegan diet is the most restrictive form of vegetarianism because it bars meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy and any other animal products.</p>
        <p>Depending on your needs and preferences, you may have to avoid the following foods on a vegetarian diet:</p>
        <li><p><b>Meat:</b> Beef, veal and pork</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Poultry:</b> Chicken and turkey</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Fish and shellfish:</b> This restriction does not apply to pescetarians.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Meat-based ingredients:</b> Gelatin, lard, carmine, isinglass, oleic acid and suet</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Eggs:</b> This restriction applies to vegans and lacto-vegetarians.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Dairy products:</b> This restriction on milk, yogurt and cheese applies to vegans and ovo-vegetarians.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Other animal products:</b> Vegans may choose to avoid honey, beeswax and pollen.</p></li>
