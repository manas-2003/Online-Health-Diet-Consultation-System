        <h1>What is the <i>Mediterranean diet?</i></h1>
        <p>The Mediterranean diet is based on the traditional foods that people used to eat in countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea, including France, Spain, Greece, and Italy.</p>
        <p>Researchers noted that these people were exceptionally healthy and had a low risk of many chronic conditions</p>
        <p>Although there are no strict rules or regulations for the diet, it typically encourages fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, and heart-healthy fats. Processed foods, added sugar, and refined grains should be restricted</p>
        <p>Numerous <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/5-studies-on-the-mediterranean-diet" class="studies">studies</a> have now shown that the Mediterranean diet can promote weight loss and help prevent heart attacks, strokes, type 2 diabetes, and premature death.</p>

        <h1>The Basics of the <i>Mediterranean Diet</i></h1>
        <p>The Mediterranean diet first became of interest to researchers in the 1950s when certain populations in the Mediterranean Sea basin were observed to be in better overall health with lower rates of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and greater longevity than wealthier nations of the Western world. Thus, the diet refers to the traditional food cultures of the countries that surround the Mediterranean Sea, including Greece, Italy, Spain, Morocco, Egypt and Lebanon. Staples of the Mediterranean diet include fruits and vegetables, whole grains, seafood, nuts and legumes, and olive oil. In lesser amounts, poultry, eggs, cheese and dairy are consumed. The Mediterranean diet is highlighted in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) as a “healthy dietary pattern.”1 But, this diet isn’t restrictive like many fad diets; rather, it emphasizes eating nutrient-dense foods without counting calories or completely omitting any one food type.</p>

        <h1>Guidelines for the <i>Mediterranean Diet</i></h1>
        <p>Unlike some diets, the Mediterranean diet does not have strict requirements. Since its parameters can vary and many people may not be familiar with the Mediterranean diet, here is a quick overview:</p>
        <br>
        <li>Most meals feature vegetables, fruits, whole grains-bread, pasta, rice, etc., and extra virgin olive oil.</li>
        <li>Most days also include nuts, seeds, dairy (preferably low-fat), and herbs and spices.</li>
        <li>Every week includes, at some point, poultry, seafood, fish, eggs, potatoes and legumes.</li>
        <li>Sugar-sweetened beverages, added sugars, processed meat and red meat are consumed sparingly.</li>
