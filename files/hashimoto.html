        <h1>Hashimoto Diet: Overview, Foods, Supplements, and Tips</h1>
        <p>Hashimoto’s thyroiditis — sometimes referred to as Hashimoto’s disease or Hashimoto’s — is one of the most common thyroid disorders in the United States and other developed countries.</p>
        <p>Even when treated with medication, its symptoms may significantly affect quality of life.</p>
        <p>Research shows that diet and lifestyle modifications, in addition to standard medication, may drastically improve symptoms. Every person with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis responds differently to treatment, which is why an individualized approach for this condition is so important.</p>

        <h2><b>Hashimoto’s thyroiditis overview </b></h2>
        <p>Diet and lifestyle play vital roles in managing Hashimoto’s, as numerous individuals find that their symptoms persist even with medication. Plus, many people who exhibit symptoms aren’t given medication unless they have altered hormone levels.</p>
        <p>What’s more, research suggests that inflammation may be a driving factor behind the wide range of Hashimoto’s symptoms. Inflammation is often tied to diet.</p>
        <p>Diet and lifestyle modifications are likewise key to reducing your risk of other ailments, as people with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis have a higher risk of developing autoimmune conditions, high cholesterol, obesity, and diabetes.</p>
        <p>Research shows that cutting out certain foods, taking supplements, and making lifestyle changes may significantly improve symptoms and quality of life.</p>
        <p>Plus, these changes may help reduce inflammation, slow or prevent thyroid damage caused by elevated thyroid antibodies, and manage body weight, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels.</p>
        <h2>Evidence-based dietary tips </h2>
        <p>Here are some evidence-based dietary tips to help treat Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.</p>
        <h3><b>Gluten- and grain-free diets</b></h3>
        <p>Many studies indicate that those with Hashimoto’s are more likely to have celiac disease than the general population. As such, experts recommend that everyone diagnosed with Hashimoto’s be screened for celiac disease.</p>
        <p>What’s more, some evidence suggests that gluten- and grain-free diets may benefit people with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.</p>
        <p>In a 6-month study in 34 women with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, a gluten-free diet reduced thyroid antibody levels while improving thyroid function and vitamin D levels, compared with a control group.</p>
        <p>Many other studies note that people with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis — or autoimmune diseases in general — likely benefit from a gluten-free diet even if they don’t have celiac disease.</p>
        <p>When following a gluten-free diet, you avoid all wheat, barley, and rye products. For example, most pastas, breads, and soy sauces contain gluten — though gluten-free alternatives exist.</p>
        <p>A grain-free diet is more restrictive than a gluten-free diet, as it bans all grains. Although this dietary change may also offer benefits, research supporting it is limited.</p>
        <h3><b>The Autoimmune Protocol diet</b></h3>
        <p>The Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) diet is designed for people with autoimmune diseases. It removes potentially harmful foods like grains, dairy, nightshades, added sugar, coffee, legumes, eggs, alcohol, nuts, seeds, refined sugars, oils, and food additives.</p>
        <p>In a 10-week study in 16 women with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, the AIP diet led to significant improvements in quality of life scores and significantly decreased levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP).</p>
        <p>Although these results are promising, larger longer duration studies are needed.</p>
        <p>Keep in mind that the AIP diet is a phased elimination diet and should be prescribed and monitored by an experienced healthcare professional.</p>
        <h3><b>Consider avoiding dairy</b></h3>
        <p>Lactose intolerance is very common among people with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.</p>
        <p>In a study of 83 women with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, 75.9% were diagnosed with lactose intolerance.</p>
        <p>If you suspect lactose intolerance, cutting out dairy may aid digestive issues, as well as thyroid function and medication absorption. Keep in mind that this strategy may not work for everyone, as some people with Hashimoto’s tolerate dairy perfectly well.</p>
        <h3><b>Focus on anti-inflammatory foods</b></h3>
        <p>Inflammation may be a driving force behind Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. As such, an anti-inflammatory diet rich in fruits and vegetables may significantly improve symptoms.</p>
        <p>A study in 218 women with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis found that markers of oxidative stress — a condition that causes chronic inflammation — were lower in those who ate fruits and vegetables more frequently.</p>
        <p>Vegetables, fruits, spices, and fatty fish are just some examples of foods with powerful anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
        <h3><b>Nutrient-dense, whole food diets</b></h3>
        <p>Following a diet low in added sugar and highly processed foods but rich in whole food, nutrient-dense foods may help improve your health, manage your weight, and reduce Hashimoto’s-related symptoms.</p>
        <p>Whenever possible, prepare your meals at home using nutritious foods like vegetables, fruits, proteins, healthy fats, and fiber-rich carbs.</p>
        <p>These foods offer powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits.</p>
        <h3><b>Other diet tips</b></h3>
        <p>Some research indicates that certain low carb diets may help reduce body weight and thyroid antibodies in people with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.</p>
        <p>These particular diets provide 12–15% of daily calories from carbs and restrict goitrogenic foods. Goitrogens are substances found in cruciferous vegetables and soy products that may interfere with thyroid hormone production.</p>
        <p>Yet, cruciferous vegetables are highly nutritious, and cooking them diminishes their goitrogenic activity. Thus, it’s unlikely that they interfere with thyroid function unless eaten in extremely large amounts.</p>
        <p>Some evidence suggests that soy harms thyroid function as well, so many people with Hashimoto’s choose to avoid soy products. Nonetheless, more research is needed.</p>
        <h2><b>Helpful supplements for Hashimoto’s</b></h2>
        <p>Several supplements may help lower inflammation and thyroid antibodies in people with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Plus, those with this condition are more likely to be deficient in certain nutrients, so supplementing may be necessary.</p>
        <p>Beneficial supplements include:</p>
        <li><b>Selenium: </b>Studies show that taking 200 mcg of selenium per day may help reduce antithyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies and improve well-being in people with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.</li>
        <li><b>Zinc: </b>Zinc is essential for thyroid function. Research suggests that when used alone or alongside selenium, taking 30 mg of zinc per day may improve thyroid function in people with hypothyroidism.</li>
        <li><b>Curcumin: </b>Animal and human studies have shown that this powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compound may protect the thyroid. Plus, it may help treat autoimmune diseases in general.</li>
        <li><b>Vitamin D: </b>People with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis have been shown to have significantly lower levels of this vitamin than the general population. What’s more, studies link low vitamin D levels with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis severity.</li>
        <li><b>B complex vitamins: </b>People with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis likewise tend to be low in vitamin B12. Taking a high quality B complex vitamin boosts levels of B12 and other important B vitamins.</li>
        <li><b>Magnesium: </b>Low levels of this mineral are associated with an increased risk of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and higher thyroid antibodies. Plus, correcting magnesium deficiencies may improve symptoms in people with thyroid disease.</li>
        <li><b>Iron: </b>People with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis are more likely to develop anemia. Iron supplements may be needed to correct a deficiency.</li>
        <p>Other supplements like fish oil, alpha-lipoic acid, and N-acetyl cysteine may also help people with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.</p>
        <p>Note that supplementing with high doses of iodine in the absence of an iodine deficiency may lead to adverse effects in those with Hashimoto’s. Don’t take high dose iodine supplements unless a healthcare professional has directed you to do so.</p>
        <h2><b>Foods to eat</b></h2>
        <p>If you have Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, a nutrient-dense diet may help reduce the severity of your symptoms and improve your overall health. Focus on the following foods.</p>
        <li><b>Fruits: </b>berries, pears, apples, peaches, citrus fruits, pineapple, bananas, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Non-starchy vegetables: </b>zucchini, artichokes, tomatoes, asparagus, carrots, peppers, broccoli, arugula, mushrooms, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Starchy vegetables:</b> sweet potatoes, potatoes, peas, acorn and butternut squash, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Healthy fats: </b>avocados, avocado oil, coconut oil, olive oil, unsweetened coconut flakes, full fat yogurt, coconut yogurt, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Animal protein: </b>salmon, eggs, cod, turkey, shrimp, chicken, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Gluten-free grains: </b>brown rice, rolled oats, quinoa, brown rice pasta, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Seeds, nuts, and nut butters: </b>cashews, almonds, macadamia nuts, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, natural peanut butter, almond butter, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Beans and lentils: </b>chickpeas, black beans, lentils, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Dairy and nondairy substitutes (fortified with calcium and/or vitamin D):</b>coconut milk, coconut yogurt, almond milk, cashew milk, full fat unsweetened yogurt, goat cheese, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Spices, herbs, and condiments: </b>turmeric, basil, rosemary, paprika, saffron, black pepper, salsa, tahini, honey, lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Beverages:</b> water, unsweetened tea, sparkling water, etc.</li>
        <p>Keep in mind that some people with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis avoid a few of the foods mentioned above, such as grains and dairy. It’s important to experiment with your diet to find out what foods work best for you.</p>
        <h2><b>Foods to avoid</b></h2>
        <p>Eliminating or restricting the following foods may help reduce Hashimoto’s symptoms and improve your overall health:</p>
        <li><b>Added sugars and sweets: </b>soda, energy drinks, cakes, ice cream, pastries, cookies, candy, sugary cereals, table sugar, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Fast food and fried foods: </b>french fries, hot dogs, fried chicken, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Refined grains:</b> white pasta, white bread, white flour tortillas, bagels, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Highly processed foods and meats: </b>frozen dinners, margarine, microwave dinners, bacon, sausage, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Gluten-containing grains and foods:</b> wheat, barley, rye, crackers, bread, etc.</li>
        <p>Some healthcare professionals suggest that people with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis avoid soy and dairy as well — and sometimes even nightshades and all grains.</p>
        <p>However, although these recommendations may help many individuals, it’s important to experiment with your diet to find the best method for you.</p>
        <p>Working with a dietitian who specializes in autoimmune diseases like Hashimoto’s thyroiditis can help you narrow down potentially problematic foods and set up an eating pattern that’ll help you feel your best.</p>
