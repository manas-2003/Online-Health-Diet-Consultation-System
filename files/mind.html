                The Mediterranean diet, which is based on the eating habits of people who live in Mediterranean countries and has been shown to improve cardiovascular health, and the DASH eating plan, which was created by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to help reduce blood pressure and improve heart health.

        <h1>What Is the MIND Diet?</h1>
        <p>Developed in 2015 by Rush University nutritional epidemiologist Martha Clare Morris and her colleagues, the MIND diet is a scientifically proven eating plan that aims to protect brain function and prevent neurodegeneration, including age-related cognitive decline and dementia.</p>
        
       <p>“The premise is that you can reduce cognitive decline with a combination of the Mediterranean and DASH diets and by adding specific foods like leafy greens and berries,” says Lisa Young, Ph.D., a registered dietitian nutritionist, adjunct professor of nutrition at New York University and author of Finally Full, Finally Slim: 30 Days to Permanent Weight Loss One Portion at a Time.</p>
        
       <p>The MIND Diet also differs from the two diets it takes inspiration from due to the focus on boosting cognitive function. It doesn’t emphasize consuming fish or fruit as much as the others do, with the exception of urging people to eat berries. Also, it includes wine (which isn’t on the DASH diet but is on the Mediterranean diet) because a moderate intake is linked to brain health.</p>

       <h1>MIND Diet Food List</h1>
        <p>You won’t have to go to great effort to find the foods on this diet; they’re all readily available.</p>
        
       <p>“The focus is on increasing your intake of high-nutrient foods—such as vegetables, nuts, berries, whole grains, fish and poultry—and minimizing high-sodium foods, meats, fried foods, pastries and sweets,” says Catherine Christie, Ph.D., a registered dietitian nutritionist and associate dean of the Brooks College of Health at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville, Florida. In addition, the MIND diet limits foods that are high in saturated fats (including cheese), while allowing a glass of wine per night.</p>
        
       <p>Here’s a closer look at foods prioritized on the MIND diet plan:</p>
        
      <p><h3>Leafy, Green Vegetables</h3></p>
       <p><b> Spinach, kale, arugula, collard greens, Swiss chard and turnip greens are rich in folate, lutein, vitamin E, beta-carotene and other nutrients that protect cognition, especially as people get older. Whether you eat them raw or cooked is up to you. It’s recommended that you consume at least six servings of green, leafy veggies a week.</b></p>
        
        <b>Recommended servings: At least seven a week</b>
       <h3>ther Veggies</h3>
<p>The MIND diet recommends eating at least one “other” nutrient-rich vegetable—such as</p>
<p><b> asparagus, beets, bell peppers, broccoli, cabbage, carrots, eggplant, okra or squash—a day. Still, an extra serving each day won’t hurt.</b></p>

<b>Recommended servings: At least one a day</b>
<h1>Benefits of the MIND Diet</h1>
<p>When it comes to health perks, you get the best of both worlds with the MIND diet. “Any benefit of the Mediterranean diet and any benefit of the DASH diet will be exaggerated in a good way with the MIND diet,” says Young.</p>

<h3>Here are some specific health benefits associated with the MIND diet:</h3>

<p>Slows Age-Related Cognitive Decline</p>
<p>Older adults who closely followed the MIND diet experienced a slower decline in various aspects of cognitive function—including episodic memory, working memory, semantic memory, visuospatial ability and perceptual speed—over the course of five years, research shows.</p>

<p>Another study found that high adherence to the MIND diet was associated with a slower rate of cognitive decline over nearly six years among older adults who had a history of stroke.</p>

<p>Reduces the Risk of Alzheimer’s Disease</p>
<p>Research has found that while high adherence to the DASH diet, the Mediterranean diet and the MIND diet all appear to reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease among older adults, even cases of just moderate adherence to the MIND diet is associated with a decreased risk of Alzheimer’s.</p>

<p>Lowers Risk of Parkinsonism Motor Impairments</p>
<p>Older adults who closely followed the MIND diet had a 13% lower risk of developing signs of parkinsonism, such as bradykinesia (slowness of movement), gait abnormalities, rigidity and tremors, over nearly five years, according to a study in a 2018 issue of the Journal of Nutrition, Health and Aging.</p>

<p>May Reduce the Risk of Breast Cancer</p>
<p>A 2021 study in Clinical Breast Cancer found that women who closely adhered to the MIND diet had 60% lower odds of breast cancer compared to those who didn’t follow it closely.</p>

<p>May Increase Your Lifespan</p>
<p>In a 12-year study involving 882 older adults, researchers found that closer adherence to the MIND diet was associated with a reduced risk of dying from all causes; those who were in the top one-third of adherence had a 37% lower risk of death compared to those in the bottom third.</p>
